# nbp-api - Client

This is a mock frontent for the nbp-api server

## Running the client

To run the client application locally, run:

```
npm start
```

It is going to server the app locally on port 3001.

**If you want to use the client app, do not change the port on the server, as client makes requests to port 8080**
