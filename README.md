# Nbp API

A RESTful API enabling users to check information regarding currencies and their prices

## Running the server

### Local server

To run this server locally, you need to have Node (^18.0.0) and npm installed

You need to first install all packages and build the source code by running the following commands while in the `server` directory:
```
npm run predeploy
```

To start the server run:
```
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can run both of these steps in the same time by running (still in the `server` directory):
```
npm run deploy
```

The server will start on port 8080 by default. To change this behaviour, provide your own .env file (see [.env example](https://github.com/tpalinski/nbp-api/blob/main/server/.env.example))

### Docker

Alternatively, you can run the server as a docker container by running these commands from the main directory:
```
docker build -t nbp-api .
docker run -p 8080:{your_preferred_port} nbp-api
```

### Client application

For detailed instructions for running the client application, see [instructions](https://github.com/tpalinski/nbp-api/blob/main/client/README.md)

## Usage

### **GET localhost:8080/exchange/{currency}/{date}**

Returns average exchange price of a currency for a day as:

```ts
{
	currency: String, // Full name of the currency
	code: String, // Currency code, e.g. gbp for British Pound
	date: String, // Supplied date
	averageRate: number // Average exchange rate
}

```

Example use:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/exchange/usd/2016-04-01
```

which should output the following response:

```
{
    "currency":"dolar amerykaÅ„ski",
    "code":"USD",
    "date":"2016-04-01",
    "averageRate":3.7193
}
```
	
Possible errors:
* 405 - Invalid date - wrong date format, date before the first date supported by the api, date in the future, nonexistent date	
* 406 - Invalid currency - API does not support this currency		
* 401 - No data for parameters - Api does not have data satisfying the parameters (usually as a result of the date being valid but not covered by NBP api)	



### **GET localhost:8080/difference/{currency}/{N}**

Returns maximum difference between bid and ask price for the last N entries:

```ts
{
	date: String // Day of Nth entry
	value: {
		maxDiff: number // Maximum difference between buy and sell
		day: String // First day when maxdiff occured
	}
}

```

Example use:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/difference/gbp/43
```

Sample response:
```
{
    "date":"2023-02-21",
    "value": {
	"maxDiff":0.10780000000000012,
	"day":"2023-02-23"
    }
}
```

Possible errors:
* 404 - N is invalid - N not in range if (0, 255>
* 400 - Malformed N - n is not a number
* 406 - Invalid currency - API does not support this currency



### **GET localhost:8080/average/{currency}/{N}**

Returns maximum and minimum average price for the last N entries:

```ts
{
    max: {
	date: String, // Date of Nth entry
	value: {
	    avg: number, // maximum average price
	    day: String // First day when max average occured
	}
    },
    min: {
	date: String // Date of Nth entry
	value: {
	    avg: // minimum average price
	    day: String // First day when min average occured
	}
    }
}

```

Example use:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/average/gbp/43
```

Sample response:
```
{
    "max": {
	"date":"2023-02-21",
	"value": {
	    "avg":5.3984,

	"value": {
	    "avg":5.2086,
	    "day":"2023-04-21"
	}
    }
}
```

Possible errors:
* 404 - N is invalid - N not in range if (0, 255>
* 400 - Malformed N - n is not a number
* 406 - Invalid currency - API does not support this currency

## Collaborating

To run server in dev mode, run (from server directory):
```
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server in watch mode.

If you want to run unit tests, run: 
```
npm run test
```
